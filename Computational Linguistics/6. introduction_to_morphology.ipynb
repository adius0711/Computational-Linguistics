    "\n",
    "* It breaks up words like `\"don't\"` into two words: `[\"do\", \"n't\"]`\n",
    "* It does not break up complex words like `\"reading\"` into two pieces (i.e., it just says the word is `[\"reading\"]`).\n",
    "* With this tokenizer, we have no way to link similarly-spelled words to each other\n",
    "* Not all languages are like English\n",
    "\n",
    "## Morphology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Morphemes** are normally defined as the smallest \"meaningful\" parts of language. When they are combined, they form more complex meanings, from single words to whole texts. The system of morphemes of a whole language is called its **morphology**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different kinds of morphemes and they can sometimes have different behavior. Every language uses morphology slightly differently. Here are just a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "* English\n",
    "  * **Inflectional morphology**: Keeps the base mostly the same\n",
    "    * Noun morphology\n",
    "      * Singular (_cat_) to plural (_cat**s**_)\n",
    "    * Verb morphology\n",
    "      * Progressive (dance to danc**ing**)\n",
    "      * Past (danced to danc**ed**) \n",
    "  * **Derivational morphology**: Changes the word to a completely different meaning\n",
    "    * American\n",
    "    * --> American**ize**\n",
    "    * ---> Americaniz**ation**\n",
    "    * ---> Americaniz**ability**\n",
    "    * ---> Americanization**ing**\n",
    "  * **Compounds**: Puts two morphemes together to create a new whole, usually with an _implicit_ grammatical relation\n",
    "    * Dollhouse (a house for dolls)\n",
    "    * Armchair (a chair with arms)\n",
    "    * Boxcar (a train car that is box-shaped)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many languages have much more complex systems than English. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For example, French has a rich system for conjugating verbs:\n",
    "  * je danse (I dance)\n",
    "  * je dans**ais** (I used to dance)\n",
    "  * je dans**erais** (I would dance)\n",
    "  * j'ai dans**é** (I danced)\n",
    "* And Estonian has lots of ways of changing nouns depending on the meaning\n",
    "  * kohvik (café)\n",
    "  * kohvik**u** (café's)\n",
    "  * kohviku**sse** (into the café)\n",
    "  * kohviku**st** (from the café)\n",
    "\n",
    "Among many other alternatives. In many indigenous languages throughout the world, more rich morphology systems exist. Other languages can even have \"words\" that express something like a whole sentence. For example, in Inuit languages, we can express the idea, \"Even though it's not snowing a great deal\" with a single word: [\"Qanniluanngikkaluaqtuq\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit_grammar#Verb_modifiers) that contains five morphemes (qanniq-, -luaq-, -nngit-, -galuaq-, -tuq). \n",
    "\n",
    "In some languages like Turkish, there is a system where the sounds within the word have to \"agree\" with the sounds of the previous morpheme. So, for example, the morpheme \"-dE\" has two possible forms: \"-de\" and \"-da\" depending on what precedes in. The phrase \"in Germany\" would be translated as \"Almanya**da**\" but \"in Turkey\" would be translated as \"Türkiyede\" because the preceding vowel (/a/ and /e/, respectively) has control over how the morpheme sounds. The multiple ways that the \"same\" morpheme can be realized in pronunciation is known as an **allomorph**. Not all allomorphs are written differently. For example, compare these two words:\n",
    "\n",
    "* cat --> cats\n",
    "* dog --> dogs\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you hear a difference in how the \"-s\" sounds at the end of the word?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>The difference is...</summary>\n",
    "that the -s in \"cats\" is said like the s in \"hiss\" ([s]) and the -s in \"dogs\" is said like the /z/ sound at the end of the word \"fries.\"\n",
    "</details>\n"

    "## Types of morphemes\n",
    "\n",
    "Different morphemes will play different roles in a word. For example, the \"sleep\" in \"sleeping\" is clearly more important to the meaning than the \"-ing\" at the end. This is because, in a language like English, \"sleep\" can more or less stand on its own and be understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The morpheme \"sleep\" in \"sleeping\" is usually called the **root** of the word. The **root morpheme** of any word is usually the most important morpheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other morphemes that are less central to the meaning are **prefixes**, which come *before* other morphemes (the **pre-** in \"prefixes\"), **suffixes** (the **-es** in \"suffixes\"), which come *after* other morphemes, **infixes** (rare in English but things like Homer Simpson's saxo-**ma**-phone.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphemes that cannot occur on their own, without being attached to anything else, are known as **bound** morphemes. For example, we cannot normally say \"pre-\" without some additional context (e.g., \"Did you pre-date or post-date this file?\" \"Pre-.\"). \\[Probably we should use another metaphor for this soon.\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphemes that can stand on their own are known as **free** morphemes because they can occur in many contexts and positions. Some good examples of free morphemes in English are words that occur in compounds -- armchair, bookcase, etc. All the words \"arm\", \"chair\", \"book\", and \"case\" can occur on their own and be added to."

    "## Traditional approaches to morphology: Finite State Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, we handled morphology with **finite state machines** and generated novel wordforms using **finite state transducers**. Finite state methods are foundational in our understanding of natural language processing approaches, but they are present in many of the systems we see every day, such as a classic gumball machine:\n",

    "<center><img src=\"http://www.openfst.org/twiki/pub/GRM/PyniniDocs/gumball.png\" alt=\"Finite state tranducer representing a gumball machine\" /></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that if we turn the nob and give the machine a coin, that we will get a gumball out. Getting a gumball will reset the knob.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted finite state transducers** are like regular finite state machines, except they assign a weight -- which can be converted to a probability -- to each transition. For the above, this could be a more complex gumball machine that 30% of the time gave you a gumball, and 70% of the time gave you one of those plastic slappy hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71agbbZgQ7L._AC_SL1452_.jpg\" width=250 alt=\"Six multicolored ticky hands toys\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is this like morphology?\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphology can also be thought of as **transitions** between sounds or morphemes. However, instead of knobs and coins and gumballs, we have sequences of morphemes, e.g., the Estonian \\<kohvik-u-sse\\> that we saw earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, finite state approaches at the highest level are appropriate characterizations of many NLP problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "One cheap way to link words with related wordforms -- and probably meanings -- together is to use the [Porter Stemmer (\"Suffix stripping\") algorithm](https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/python.txt). It is rarely used today, because it does not generally do a sophisticated enough job at breaking words into their constituent morphemes. But, it is a fast and efficient algorithm that simplies word forms. For example, it will take a word like \"stopping\" and produce \"stop\" because it simplifies doubled consonants (\"pp\") and strips off specific word endings (\"-ing\")."
