    "\n",
    "  Lots of other sequences are like this in English. For example, the \"n't\" in \"didn't\". In other languages, it is even more important to separate out words that are written together.

    "\n",
    "Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer. We sometimes make decisions that are based on **linguistic knowledge** (\"cats\" and \"sister's\" are not contractions, but \"He's\" is). On the other hand, in many real-world applications, we might make our decisions based on how well our models perform -- making decisions on the basis of **model performance** happens very often in practice. Which decision you make will depend a bit on properties of the data you are working with.\n"
