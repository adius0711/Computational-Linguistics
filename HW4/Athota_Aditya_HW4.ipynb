For this assignment, you will be using `pandas` in addition to your own knowledge of linguistic structure from the readings. This assignment requires the qualitative and quantitative assessment of several parts of a very small corpus. \n","\n","The coding components of this assignment will largely require loading in the data and building a simple input system that allows you to classify two instances of the same string as they appear in different sentences as meaning the same or different things. \n","\n","The assignment is designed to give you a feel for what we want out of computational models of semantic representations of words and also give you experience doing annotation for NLP tasks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_-214d0dvukt"},"source":["# The problem: Ambiguous words\n","\n","Language is often ambiguous, with the same string or series of sounds corresponding to different meanings. This **ambiguity** leads to challenges for NLP, such as distinguishing between seriousness and sarcasm (e.g., \"That was great\"), or between completely different, unrelated meanings (e.g., \"I couldn't bear to part with it\" vs. \"The bear did not want to part with it\"). Often, we are interested in identifying what meaning a word has in context. Can we properly guess what a speaker means by \"bear\", or \"great\"?\n","\n","One of the major areas of natural language processing is **Word Sense Disambiguation** (WSD). Under these schemes, a string is assumed to have several possible **senses**, or distinct meanings. We will discuss in greater detail in class why the idea that words have distinct meanings is challenging, from identifying and differentiating these meanings to building models that can assign a label to a given instance of a word. \n","\n","## The dataset\n","\n","This assignment will center around annotating a dataset of sentences that are stored in a `.tsv` file. This dataset, like the others we have worked with, contains one \"document\" per line. Each document in this dataset corresponds to one line, or subtitle, from a corpus of English subtitles for movies, along with some **metadata**. This particular file is structured as a matrix where the rows are records and the columns are values for that record -- it is very similar to a dictionary structure.\n","\n","The subtitles are presented out of context, one on each line in the `.tsv`.\n","\n","Some example subtitles, in the first column of the dataframe (`\"subtitle\"`) will look like this:\n","\n","* \"Neither his post , nor adjacent .\"\n","* \"Send men out to post a guard .\"\n","\n","In the column `'word'` you will find **ambiguous words**. We have selected a small number of ambiguous words for you that have a diverse range of meanings for each. \n","\n","The dataset itself comes from [Rice et al. (2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-018-1107-7), a study that looked at how common different types of ambiguous words were in a corpus of subtitles. In the third column in the tsv is the `'meaning_label'`. This is a categorical label (a string `str`) for meanings from an internet dictionary called Wordsmyth. The values are often represented as numbers (\"1\", \"2\"), but may also be represented as a dash character \"-\" to indicate something like, this meaning is \"not in the Wordsmyth list.\" The labels themselves have been defined somewhat informally by lexicographers. The label you see was the product of two separate annotators (students in the Rice et al. paper's lab) going through each of these sentences by hand and assigning labels to them with the help of the dictionary.\n","\n","Here we will be doing something similar, but less complex."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"u23wQRbv1Yfs"},"source":["# Question 0: Your imports (1 point)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QfyBL7Q91btk"},"source":["# put all of your imports here\n","from google.colab import drive, files\n","import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dHnErlZKu88I"},"source":["# Question 1: Loading in data using pandas (1 point)\n","\n","Import your code below and load the file `ambiguous.tsv` into the notebook.

An early example of such an algorithm was the Yarowsky algorithm.

We will retrain the algorithm and hyper tune the parameters properly whenever a new piece of data is encountered, and we will employ the semi-supervised approach. My suggested semi-supervised based method will produce optimal results when trained using an effective classifier, provided the training data has been accurately labeled and sufficient attention has been taken when labeling the same.\n","\n","Now we'll use the ML algorithm to generate labels for the new data using the labelled data. Assuming that our machine learning algorithm is effective, the new supervised technique will be able to discover the patterns and context in which the sentence might be read, as well as which synonyms of the word \"zip\" are considered when making a choice. These complexities will be taken care of by a good algorithm, which will aid us in overcoming the WSD and appropriately labeling the data.\n","\n","Other semi-supervised algorithms use enormous amounts of untagged corpora to complement the tagged corpora with co-occurrence information. These methods have the potential to aid in the adaption of supervised models to a variety of domains.\n","\n"]}]}
